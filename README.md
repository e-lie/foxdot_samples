This repository is meant to version the samples I use with FoxDot and more generally my music livecoding environment.

I'll try to give credit for all those sounds creators.

### Reproducing here the credit Qirky wrote for original FoxDot samples

FoxDot's audio files have been obtained from a number of sources but I've lost record of which files are attributed to which original author. Here's a list of thanks for the unknowing creators of FoxDot's sample archive.

- Legowelt Sample Kits
- Game Boy Drum Kit
- A number of sounds courtesy of Mike Hodnick's live coded album, Expedition
- Many samples have been obtained from http://freesound.org and have been placed in the public domain via the Creative Commons 0 License: http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ - thank you to the original creators
- Other samples have come from the Dirt Sample Engine which is part of the TidalCycles live coding language created by Yaxu - another huge amount of thanks.

If you feel I've used a sample where I shouldn't have, please get in touch!
